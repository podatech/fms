**The service layer** resides below the web layer. It acts as a transaction boundary and contains both application and infrastructure services. The **application services** provides the public API of the service layer. They also act as a transaction boundary and are responsible of authorization. The **infrastructure services** contain the “plumbing code” that communicates with external resources such as file systems, databases, or email servers. Often these methods are used by more than a one application service.
